Adds the `liquid` wish, for spawning a pool of liquid. To use it, you need to know the internal name of the liquid you want. This information can be found [on the wiki](https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Category:Liquids) on any given liquid's page.

Examples:

- `liquid:water:1` spawns 1 dram of water.
- `liquid:proteangunk:2000` spawns 2000 drams of primordial soup.
