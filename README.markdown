This is a collection of tiny *Caves of Qud* mods that I have no plans to upload to Steam Workshop. I make no promises that they're balanced or fun. In fact, they will probably ruin your game in some way or another. Enjoy!

# Installation

See [the official *Caves of Qud* wiki](https://cavesofqud.gamepedia.com/Modding:Installing_a_mod) for instructions. Note that this repository is not itself a mod; the directories immediately within it are all individual mods that can be installed separately from each other.
