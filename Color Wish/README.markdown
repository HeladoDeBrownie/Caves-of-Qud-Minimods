While occupying the body you wish to recolor (e.g., yours), wish for `recolor`. You can choose both the main and detail colors.

If you ever wish to revert to the colors your character was already using, wish `unrecolor`.

**Note:** Because of the way this mod overrides colors, if you remove it from a save you've used it in, you will encounter some errors loading your save. To avoid this, before removing the mod, wish `unrecolor` for each creature you've recolored.
