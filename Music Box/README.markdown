This mod adds a music player. Wish for it with `HDBrownie_Music Box_Music Player`. Activating the music player allows you to pick a track from a fixed selection and play that instead of whatever else would be playing. It's robust against changing zones, and when deactivated causes the current zone's music to play if it has any.

This mod is dedicated to, and the original idea of, Caelyn Sandel.
