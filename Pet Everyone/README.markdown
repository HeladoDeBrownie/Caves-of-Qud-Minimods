Makes most creatures potentially pettable.

To pet someone, open their interact menu (one way is, by default, press Ctrl+Space and then a direction, and select them from the list) and select `pet`.

Note that if you use the `Use` option for chatting and petting (by default, press Space), this mod changes the behavior of *all* creatures, including those already pettable in the base game, so that this will chat with them and not pet them. You can still pet them from the interact menu.
