While occupying the body you wish to recolor (e.g., yours), wish for `recolor`. You can choose both the main and detail colors. Note that if the "Color player's @ based on HP level." option is on, the main color will be unaffected for as long as you occupy the body.

If you ever wish to revert to the colors your character was already using, wish `unrecolor`.

**Note:** Because of the way this mod overrides colors, if you remove it from a save you've used it in, you will encounter some errors loading your save. To avoid this, before removing the mod, wish `unrecolor` for each creature you've recolored.
